	<h1>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h1>

		<p>I am most inspred by <a href="http://madebycourse.com">madebycourse.com</a> and <a href="http://magazine.good.is">Good Magazine</a>.</p>

	<h1>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h1>

		<p>The Course design studio subscribes to a less is more mantra. Their ethos is that "...In a world saturated with clutter, we think insightfully in order to achieve conscious and clear results. Our intention is to provide value, not add noise." With a clear design philosophy like the one they describe it is important that the site also exhibit a clear and uncluttered image. The use of a large photo of the two designers creates a brand without being in your face. The typography is allowed to create positive space while focusing the user on the content and has the effect of creating design with the typography.

		<p>Good Magazine has far greater content with a broader focus yet the strong use of the Good logo creates a cohesive accross the site. The use of the negative space allows the content to be highlighted and keeps the user moving accross the site. The balance they create in the site is achieved by changing the columns and yet keeping the negative space consistant.</p>

	<h1>What makes them similar and different?</h1>

		<p>Both of the sites understand that negative space can elevate the content and focus the user. They both effectively use a combination of columns to create a break within the content and create a refocusing of the users attention to either a new focus or new content.</p>

		<p>Good Magazine uses more color and more annimations within the site. Not always to good effect. It has the tendency to create visual noise rather than impact. Made By Course understands that negative space does not always have to be white and that by alternating the background color they are creating stronger focus. There is little content on the page but that use of color somehow elevates the content and gives it greater imapct.</p>

	<h1>Thumbnail sketches</h1>

	<ul>
		
		<li><strong>Title Area</strong></li>

			<img src="page1.jpg" alt="Page 1" style="width:218px;height:325px">
			
			<p>My attempt is to add focal points by varying the columns used across each area of the page. This is a singe page website with about 5 different areas of content. In addition I plan on using a line to break up each area as well as possibly vary the background color slightly to create focus.</p>

		<li><strong>Navigation Area</strong></li>

			<img src="page2.jpg" alt="Page 2" style="width:218px;height:325px">

			<p>The navigation bar will be used at the bottom of the visible page and locked to the browser window. If the user wants to navigate to a different section of the page they will simply click on that section navigation link and it will take them to that section on the page. </p>

			<p>This is a very word based page so the images will be used simply to keep visual interest without distracting from the content. Picking the right font will also be important and will help to create visual appeal across the page.</p>

		<li><strong>Both Thumbnails Combined</strong></li>
